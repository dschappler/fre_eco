Freemium Metrics

Retention
Retention is a retroactive, time-based measure of product use.
At the user level, retention metrics are binary indications (true/false) of whether or not a user returned to the product some specific number of days after first using it
At the product level, retention metrics are aggregated across the user base
The purpose of retention metrics is to track the frequency and longevity of product use
The retention profile curve provides some guidance in the product development process when designing features to boost retention
Higher retention corresponds to a better product experience, greater personal investment, and a higher level of fulfillment in the productâ€™s fundamental use case.
