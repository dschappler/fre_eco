Freemium Metrics

Retention
Retention is a retroactive, time-based measure of product use.
At the user level, retention metrics are binary indications (true/false) of whether or not a user returned to the product some specific number of days after first using it
At the product level, retention metrics are aggregated across the user base
The purpose of retention metrics is to track the frequency and longevity of product use
The retention profile curve provides some guidance in the product development process when designing features to boost retention
Higher retention corresponds to a better product experience, greater personal investment, and a higher level of fulfillment in the product’s fundamental use case.
Retention Metrics: 
    DAU (daily active users)
    DNU (daily new users)

It is usually presented as a percentage of users who have made a purchase either up until a specific day or over the lifetime of a product

Engagement
Engagement metrics measure the extent to which users interact with products but also help curate those interactions.
Onboarding- / FirstSession-Funnel: A user’s first session with a product is a critical determinant of the user’s lifetime with the product; it is therefore worthy of the product team’s when trying to optimize the user experience.
The onboarding funnel is an events-based graph of user fall-off, or product abandonment within the formative first moments of interaction between the user and the product. 
The onboarding funnel should be used to measure how well the use case is communicated and instructed.
